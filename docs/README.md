# Grimório TRPG
Grimório para Tormenta RPG

Website developed using HTML5, CSS3 and [Angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js).
Angular.js libraries used: [ng-showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/ng-showdown), [ui.router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router), [ui.router.stateHelper](https://github.com/marklagendijk/ui-router.stateHelper)

This website was developed based on [Roenmidnight](https://github.com/roenmidnight)'s website: roenmidnight.github.io/grimorio-trpg/
Also, the spells scripts were made from his own posts, so I have a lot to thank him for.

The spells markdown files are in a different repository (GitHub Pages didn't allow the page generation in the same repository), and the python scripts used to create the json with the spells and its properties are also there:

## Future projects

Add another dynamic page, with Tormenta's characters possible feats.
