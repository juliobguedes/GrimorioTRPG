[Tormenta Spellbook](https://juliobguedes.github.io/TormentaSpellbook/)

## Description

Website developed using HTML5, CSS3 and [Angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js).
Angular.js libraries used: [ng-showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/ng-showdown), [ui.router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router), [ui.router.stateHelper](https://github.com/marklagendijk/ui-router.stateHelper)

This website was developed based on [Roenmidnight](https://github.com/roenmidnight)'s website: roenmidnight.github.io/grimorio-trpg/
Also, the spells scripts were made from his own posts, so I have a lot to thank him for.

The spells markdown files are in the [spells/](https://github.com/juliobguedes/TormentaSpellbook/tree/master/spells) and [feats/](https://github.com/juliobguedes/TormentaSpellbook/tree/master/feats) folders. You can also check the scripts used to generate and modify files in the [python scrips/](https://github.com/juliobguedes/TormentaSpellbook/tree/master/python%20scripts) folder or check out the [scripts description](https://github.com/juliobguedes/TormentaSpellbook/tree/master/python%20scripts/DESCRIPTION.md).
